                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    EIEs are passionate visionaries powered by extroverted feeling (Fe<sup>+</sup>) base and introverted intuition (Ni<sup>–</sup>) creative. Their Fe base is 4-dimensional and high-intensity – EIEs live and breathe the emotional currents of human interaction. They are adept at inspiring others, conveying sentiments dramatically, and rallying people around ideas or causes. With a "plus" Fe, they tap into a wide spectrum of emotional expression, often amplifying the mood to create momentum or urgency. They aren't afraid of strong feelings; in fact, they believe that a surge of enthusiasm, outrage, or joy can be the catalyst for meaningful change.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Paired with this is Ni<sup>–</sup> creative, which gives them a strategic, if sometimes cautionary, sense of timing and destiny. EIEs use Ni to weave narratives about where things are headed – their intuition often focuses on the grand arc of events, cultural movements, or an individual's potential path (with a "minus" tilt, meaning they're sensitive to what could go wrong or what challenges lie ahead).
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    In flow, an EIE resembles a charismatic storyteller or leader-for-a-cause: they might be on stage (literal or metaphorical), captivating an audience with a compelling vision of the future, charged with emotional conviction. They thrive when they can align their personal fervor with a larger purpose. Their Fe-Ni synergy allows them to not only stir hearts in the moment but also offer a direction or prophecy – "This is where we're headed if we don't change, and this is how I feel about it!" EIEs often have an imaginative, almost theatrical streak; life for them is full of meaning and drama, and they feel most alive when engaging both.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Critic</h2>
                <div className="prism-card p-6">
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The Critic block for EIE encompasses their more prosaic and practical weaknesses: introverted sensing (Si) as role and introverted logic (Ti) as vulnerable. Si (2D) is something EIEs try to manage – they know they ought to handle day-to-day logistics and self-care, and at times they will make genuine efforts (an EIE might, for instance, throw a lovely dinner party paying attention to decor and cuisine, or attempt a fitness regimen). But these efforts usually have an ulterior motive linked to Fe/Ni goals (such as creating an atmosphere for their friends or keeping themselves energized for their work). Sustained attention to mundane routines doesn't come naturally. If life forces an EIE into a too-simple, domestic, or repetitive role, they can feel stifled or depressed.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Ti (1D) is an EIE's Achilles heel: they find strictly logical, rule-based frameworks confining and often get tangled in details or inconsistency when they try to follow them. In moments of collapse – say, when confronted with bureaucratic red tape, technical manuals, or a debate demanding rigorous logic – EIEs can feel extremely frustrated and insecure. They might overcompensate by citing half-understood theories or by rejecting the premise of logic altogether ("this is heartless and nitpicky!").
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Under stress, an EIE can become erratic: one minute excessively controlling (in a panicked attempt to impose order via their limited Ti/Si grasp), and the next minute overwhelmed by emotion or pessimism (Ni- seeing doom everywhere). They may oscillate between idealism and despair. Emotionally, while they're adept at rousing others, their own feelings can sometimes run away from them. An EIE might experience emotional burnout, where their usual fiery energy crashes into exhaustion – a sign they've been running hot for too long without attending to Si needs like rest and stability.

                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      In the Hidden block, EIEs carry a respect for precisely what they lack: Si suggestive means they deeply appreciate those who are calm, grounded, and can take care of practical matters. An EIE often benefits from a stable partner or team who keeps their environment comfortable and schedules on track – this allows the EIE to soar without burning up. They also have Te mobilizing, indicating that with maturity, EIEs do develop better analytical and organizational skills, especially as it pertains to advancing their vision. Many EIEs learn to navigate media, politics, or complex plans, not out of love for cold logic but because they recognize it's necessary to give their ideals real impact. For example, an EIE activist might teach themselves the intricacies of lawmaking (Te) to push their emotional appeals into concrete legislation.

                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Instinct Block</h3>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      In the Instinct block, EIEs wield powerful yet background talents. They have strong hidden personal ethics (Fi demonstrative) – despite their public expressiveness, they often privately hold very specific loyalties and convictions about right/wrong that guide their choices of allies and causes. And they possess a quiet reservoir of willful endurance (Se ignoring) – while not as overtly forceful as a Se-base type, a determined EIE can demonstrate surprising tenacity and even confrontational courage when a situation reaches a boiling point. They generally prefer persuasion over coercion, but if pushed to the wall, they won't shy away from a fight to defend their vision.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                      Developmentally, EIEs grow by learning to pace and ground themselves. As they expand, they often adopt routines or physical practices (from yoga to simply remembering to eat/sleep on schedule) to harness their energy sustainably. They also sharpen their message with facts and structure (honing their Te/Ti) so that their passion doesn't exist in an echo chamber. With life experience, an EIE typically becomes a wiser idealist – still fervent and inspiring, but more measured in execution and resilient in the face of setbacks. Their highs and lows even out somewhat, resulting in a figure who can lead and uplift others through both the storms and calms of progress.
