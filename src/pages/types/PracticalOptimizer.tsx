                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    You are a methodical, dependable person who takes pride in upholding traditions, principles, and responsibilities. Your dominant Introverted Sensing (Si) gives you a strong memory for detail and a deep respect for the lessons of experience. You tend to trust what is tried-and-true; you carefully store past experiences and observations, creating an internal library of "how things are done" and "what has proven to work."
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    This makes you extremely reliable – if you've done something before or learned the correct way, you will diligently apply that knowledge. You likely have a meticulous eye: ISTJs often notice inconsistencies or errors that others gloss over, whether it's a number out of place or someone not following the rules.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Supporting this is auxiliary Extraverted Thinking (Te), which drives you to organize your outer world and make efficient, logical decisions. You excel at creating structure: making lists, schedules, procedures, and ensuring everyone (including yourself) follows them. Because of this, others see you as a steady anchor – the coworker who meets deadlines and maintains standards, the family member who handles bills and logistics on time, or the friend who can be counted on for practical help.

                    You value honesty, hard work, and loyalty, and you demonstrate these values through your actions consistently. You might be more reserved in demeanor; ISTJs are often quiet until they have something relevant to say, and they prefer to keep conversations factual and task-focused unless they're with very close friends.

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    You find satisfaction in working through a well-defined task or refining a system to run smoothly. You might experience flow organizing data into a coherent report, fixing up your home or workspace for optimal efficiency, or methodically practicing a skill (like programming, accounting, or even a hobby like woodworking or gardening) where you can measure concrete progress.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    You enjoy knowing what's expected of you and then exceeding those expectations with your thoroughness. During these moments, you can become so absorbed that you lose track of time – perhaps you start the day cleaning the garage, and before you know it, hours have passed and everything is perfectly in order and labeled. That kind of accomplishment – turning chaos into order – is deeply gratifying for you.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    You also enter a comfortable flow during routines you cherish: for example, following a morning ritual or continuing a family tradition gives you a sense of continuity and peace.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Internal Critic & Growth</h2>
                <div className="space-y-6">
                  <div className="prism-card p-6">
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Adaptability Challenges</h3>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      Your challenges often revolve around adaptability and emotions. Your Internal Critic (tertiary Fi, inferior Ne) can cause you to sometimes struggle with situations that demand quick changes or have no clear precedent. Since you rely on established methods, being thrown into a completely novel scenario can be stressful – your inner voice might panic, "We've never done this before; this could go wrong!" That's inferior Ne expressing anxiety about unpredictable outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                      Under stress, ISTJs may catastrophize about "what-if" scenarios (unusual for you, but it happens when Ne is triggered negatively) or become uncharacteristically scattered as they try to brainstorm without their usual structure. Generally, though, you cope by doubling down on routine and what you know.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div className="prism-card p-6">
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Values & Self-Criticism</h3>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      Another aspect of your internal critic stems from tertiary Fi – while normally private about your feelings, you do have strong personal values and can be quite hard on yourself if you think you've acted against them. For instance, if loyalty is a value and you missed attending a friend's important event, you might silently reproach yourself for a long time. Or you may feel guilt if you bent a rule that you believe in.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                      However, because Fi is tertiary, you might not easily articulate these feelings, instead just feeling a general discomfort or irritability.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div className="prism-card p-6">
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Common Friction Points</h3>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      You may come off to others as rigid or too serious at times. Phrases like "We've always done it this way" or "Rules exist for a reason" make total sense to you (and often you're right!), but more spontaneous or change-oriented folks might find you inflexible. Similarly, you have a strong internal sense of duty and might expect the same of others, which can lead to frustration when people are careless or inconsistent.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                      Emotionally, ISTJs are not effusive – you show you care through actions more than words. While you are very loyal and stable in relationships, you might forget to verbally appreciate others or express affection, assuming it's understood. This can lead to loved ones feeling a bit neglected on the emotional front.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div className="prism-card p-6">
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Growth Path</h3>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      To grow, it can help to consciously practice small acts of emotional expression – a compliment here, a surprise there – and adaptability. Your Hidden Potential functions (Ne/Fi) suggest that you can benefit from occasionally embracing change and considering what truly matters to you personally (beyond duty).
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                      Trying new experiences in a controlled way (like traveling to a different culture, or brainstorming without immediately judging the ideas) can expand your comfort zone. Also, checking in with your own feelings and values (Fi) can ensure you're not living life on autopilot or solely by others' expectations; what you desire is important too, even if you don't often broadcast it.

                    Continue to honor your strengths – your word is your bond, and your dependability is a rare asset. In a world full of flakes and shortcuts, you stand for integrity, quality, and perseverance. When you allow yourself to adapt just a notch more to life's surprises and to share a bit of your heart with those who've earned your trust, you'll find a balanced confidence.

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">

Lean into that, and remember that every once in a while, rocks can roll – it's okay to embrace change thoughtfully when it leads to a better path.
