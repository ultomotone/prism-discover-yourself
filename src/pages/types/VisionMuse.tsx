                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    IEIs are poetic seers, driven by introverted intuition (Ni) base and extroverted feeling (Fe) creative. Their Ni base is 4-dimensional, immersing them in the underlying currents of time and psychology. IEIs naturally detect patterns, symbolic meanings, and potential crises on the horizon – often experiencing life as a story with foreshadowing. Since their Ni has a "minus" overlay, they are keenly attuned to what could go wrong or what is fading away; there's a melancholic or cautious streak to their vision.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    They might sense approaching cultural shifts or the eventual consequences of present actions, sometimes feeling like old souls who already "remember the future" in bits and pieces. Complementing this is their Fe creative function, which they use to communicate their insights and connect emotionally. IEIs aren't as loud as their extroverted EIE cousins, but they can be deeply expressive in one-on-one settings or in artistic mediums. With plus-Fe, they can tap into intense emotional states (often wearing their heart on their sleeve when inspired), ranging from passionate idealism to dramatic sorrow.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    In flow, an IEI often appears as an introspective artist or a visionary advisor: imagine a novelist lost in weaving an epic tale, or a counselor who seems to understand a person's destiny better than the person themselves. They excel in roles where they can ponder and then articulate meaning – using metaphor, storytelling, or gentle coaching to illuminate the path for others. Their strong Ni-Fe pairing means they often have an ethereal charisma; they may be quiet or shy superficially, but they draw people in with a kind of mystique and depth of feeling.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Critic</h2>
                <div className="prism-card p-6">
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The Critic block for IEI features extroverted sensing (Se) as role and extroverted logic (Te) as vulnerable. Se (2D) for IEIs is like a sometimes worn but uncomfortable costume – they can put on a show of assertiveness or take charge in short bursts if a situation absolutely demands it. For instance, an IEI might force themselves to meet a deadline (Se push) or step up in a moment of crisis to protect someone, but it's not sustainable. They typically avoid direct confrontation and high-pressure competition, as it clashes with their gentle, reflective nature.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Te (1D) is their least developed function. Crunching numbers, organizing logistics, or making quick cost-benefit decisions can feel overwhelming to them. In a collapse scenario – such as being thrust into a managerial position or having to survive in a rough, no-nonsense environment – IEIs can become disoriented and anxious. They might procrastinate or escape into daydreams when hard Te tasks loom, simply because they don't know where to start or fear failure.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Under prolonged stress, an IEI may show erratic behavior: neglecting practical duties (missed appointments, unpaid bills) while obsessing over ominous fantasies or emotional dramas that may not be objectively urgent. Emotionally, they are sensitive and can be thrown off balance by harsh criticism or reality checks that conflict with their idealized visions. They sometimes struggle to regulate these emotions, leading to cycles of brooding (Ni) and emotional venting (Fe) – e.g., writing a cathartic poem or having a sudden tearful moment – after which they might feel somewhat cleansed. However, lacking Te means they don't always act on resolving the external problem, which can create a loop of recurring distress.

              <section>
                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Hidden & Instinct</h2>
                <div className="space-y-6">

                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Hidden Block</h3>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      In the Hidden block, IEIs secretly long for stability and effectiveness to complement their dreaming. Si suggestive means they deeply appreciate people who provide physical comfort, reliable routine, or practical care. A partner who reminds them to eat or helps organize their messy desk can be a godsend. It's not that IEIs want to be babied; rather, having that grounding presence frees them to explore their inner world without floating away entirely.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                      Their mobilizing Te suggests that as they mature, IEIs make efforts to strengthen their worldly competency. Many IEIs eventually learn to manage certain responsibilities or even develop expertise in a technical area that supports their passion (for example, an IEI musician learning the ins and outs of sound engineering to better produce their music).
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div className="prism-card p-6">
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Instinct Block</h3>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      In the Instinct block, IEIs harbor potent yet quiet faculties. They have strong inner principles about relationships (Fi demonstrative) – while they might seem very open to various people outwardly, privately they know exactly whom they love and who has crossed unforgivable lines. They can surprisingly cut ties if someone violates their core values, even though they generally dislike conflict; this is their firm Fi in action behind the scenes.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      They also possess more analytical acumen (Ti ignoring) than they let on – an IEI often can grasp complex theories or logical systems, but they keep their understanding intuitive and may not articulate it formally. They'll, for instance, "just know" how a complicated plot should resolve or have an instinctual sense of a solution but struggle to explain why in a step-by-step way.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                      Growth for IEIs often means gently coming down to earth. As they expand, successful IEIs learn to pair their rich imagination with some discipline: setting small routines, seeking mentors or friends who hold them accountable, and gradually facing practical challenges they'd rather avoid. They also learn to voice their needs instead of expecting others to intuit them (strengthening a bit of Se/Te to ask for and implement what they want). When an IEI balances vision with reality, they become a powerful bridge between the possible and the actual – guiding others with compassion and foresight, while quietly ensuring their own feet stay on the ground.
