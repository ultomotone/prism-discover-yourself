                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    You are a take-charge, results-oriented person who believes in duty, reliability, and getting things done right. Your dominant Extraverted Thinking (Te) makes you a natural organizer and leader in virtually any setting. You have a keen eye for inefficiency and cannot stand when things are disorganized or goal-less – your impulse is to step in and impose order.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    ESTJs are often the ones coordinating plans, enforcing policies, or supervising operations, because you do it so well. You think in clear, structured terms: define the objective, map out the process, assign roles, execute. Your communication is typically straightforward and assertive; people rarely have to guess where you stand on an issue.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Supporting this, your auxiliary Introverted Sensing (Si) gives you a strong memory for detail and precedent. You respect traditions, proven methods, and hierarchical structures that have stood the test of time. Often, you serve as the custodian of best practices in your group – you remember how things were done and ensure important routines or rituals are maintained.

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Together, Te-Si produces a personality often nicknamed "The Executive" or "Supervisor." You likely take pride in being responsible and trustworthy. If you say you'll do something, you will do it, and probably do it early and under budget! You also value community engagement and can be quite social in a practical way (think organizing community events, leading a club, or being the dependable friend who fixes things).

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">In Flow</h2>
                <div className="prism-card p-6">
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    You shine when you're managing a project or operation efficiently. You love checking off a well-organized to-do list, achieving tangible results, and keeping everything running like clockwork. For instance, you might experience flow while coordinating a major event (ensuring every logistic is handled), or at work when you're streamlining a process that saves time and money. You feel energized by accomplishment and by upholding standards of excellence.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Another flow state for ESTJ can be competitive endeavors that reward preparation and skill – you channel your natural discipline into sports, debates, or even games, and the act of striving to win within established rules is exhilarating. You are fundamentally action-oriented, so stagnation drains you, but a challenging goal focuses your energy in a very satisfying way.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    When everything and everyone is in alignment under your guidance, it's like a well-conducted orchestra – that's the kind of harmony you appreciate.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Internal Critic & Growth</h2>
                <div className="space-y-6">
                  <div className="prism-card p-6">
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Flexibility Challenges</h3>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      On the flip side, your focus on order and correctness can make you inflexible or impatient in certain situations. Your Internal Critic (tertiary Ne, inferior Fi) can make dealing with sudden change or ambiguous situations a sore spot. Because you rely on Si's past experience and Te's logical plans, when something totally unexpected or "illogical" happens, it frustrates you.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      You might inwardly scold yourself (or others) when caught off-guard: "I should have anticipated that!" or "Why are people being so random/unreliable?" That's your inferior Ne discomfort – an aversion to the chaotic or unproven.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                      Under extreme stress, some ESTJs fall into an Ne grip: they may start imagining worst-case scenarios or feel overwhelmed by too many unknowns, leading to anxiety (very unlike their usual confident self). However, more commonly others see your stress in how you externalize it: you may become overly controlling, micromanaging, and raising your voice or strictness. Your patience for deviation drops to zero.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div className="prism-card p-6">
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Emotional Considerations</h3>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      The other part of your internal challenge is Fi – your own and others' feelings. As someone who values facts and objective decisions, emotional considerations can seem like irrelevant or bothersome noise. You likely keep your own emotions private and may even feel awkward with displays of sentiment.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      This can result in unintended insensitivity: for example, you might implement a change at work very practically, not realizing some team members feel hurt or demoralized by it. Or in personal life, you might give plenty of practical support to a loved one but forget to say "I love you" or show empathy in words, assuming they know you care by your actions.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                      Over time, those around you might feel underappreciated or unheard on a personal level, even though you truly do care about their welfare (you just show it through being responsible).
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div className="prism-card p-6">
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Growth Path</h3>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      To grow, working on active listening and flexibility is key. Your Hidden Potential functions (Ne/Fi) indicate that embracing a bit more open-minded creativity and personal reflection will make you more effective and fulfilled. For example, when a novel idea comes up, instead of instinctively dismissing it as impractical, give yourself time to consider it – maybe even brainstorm (Ne) how it could work or recall times something new did succeed.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      And regarding Fi, allow yourself to occasionally prioritize values over logic. Ask, "Does this align with what I really care about or what others care about?" even if it's not the most efficient on paper. Also, cultivating empathy: recognizing that not everyone has your thick skin or straightforward nature. Sometimes people just need encouragement or understanding rather than instruction.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                      By paying attention to the human element, you'll actually enhance team morale and loyalty, which ultimately furthers your goals too.

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    You are at your best when you uphold integrity, tradition, and efficiency in a balanced way. Your leadership and organizational abilities are immense strengths; you're often the backbone of whichever group you're in, turning plans into reality. Continue to be that reliable pillar – society needs people like you to function smoothly.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Just remember that rules and goals serve people, not the other way around. If you sometimes bend a rule to show compassion, or take a detour to accommodate a new idea, it won't betray your principles – it will show your wisdom. When you integrate a bit of flexibility and understanding with your natural drive, you truly exemplify the best of the "executive" type: effective and respected.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    In flow, you'll not only accomplish great things, but also enjoy the trust and admiration of those you lead, knowing that you care about them as much as the results.
