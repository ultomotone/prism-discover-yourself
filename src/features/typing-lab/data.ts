    summary:
      "Contact-dominant operator who sets terms in live rooms (Se) and prosecutes via definitions (Ti), rallies as needed (Fe), and sustains a field machine (Te). Not LIE because on-mic cadence leads with contact over systems; not EIE because Fe reads mobilizing, not leading.",
    rationale:
      "Campus debates, long-form podcasts, and tour stops consistently open with definition control before moving into pressure moves, matching an SLE lead with creative Ti and demonstrative Te.",
    differentiator:
      "Compared to Te-first operators he foregrounds room leverage and live prosecution; compared to EIE presenters he keeps affect tight, using Fe as a momentum dial rather than broad-band steering.",
    confidenceExplanation:
      "Confidence is Medium because Se-contact and Ti-prosecution are consistent across settings, with clear Te operations. Alternates LIE/EIE explain slices. Confidence would rise with more Te-first on-mic systems talk ruled out and more broad-band Fe modulation ruled out. Confidence would fall if repeated Te-first cadence appears under pressure or if Fe shows wide-band mixing across registers.",
    overlayExplanation:
      "+ indicates a tendency toward higher arousal/intensity in adversarial or stage conditions, which amplifies Se and Fe expression and compresses time horizons. Overlay is not a type change.",
