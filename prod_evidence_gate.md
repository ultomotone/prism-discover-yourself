# Production Evidence Gate - Status Update

**Session ID**: 618c5ea6-aeda-4084-9156-0aac9643afd3
**Environment**: Production (gnkuikentdtnatazeriu)  
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-17T16:31:00Z

## PHASE C - RLS Apply Results ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ SUCCESS - RLS Policies Applied
- **profiles table**: Service role policy `svc_manage_profiles` created ‚úÖ
- **fc_scores table**: Service role policy `svc_manage_fc_scores` created ‚úÖ
- **Migration**: Completed successfully with no errors ‚úÖ
- **Rollback**: Available via `migrations/prod_rls_rollback.sql` ‚úÖ

## PHASE D - Evidence Collection Status ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Database Evidence - Current State
- **fc_scores**: ‚úÖ PASS
  - version = `v1.2` ‚úÖ
  - scores_json type = `object` ‚úÖ
  - Valid data present from 2025-09-17 15:52:34

- **profiles**: ‚ùå MISSING
  - No profile record found
  - Session shows as finalized (2025-09-17 15:52:36.076Z)
  - **Root Cause**: Profile creation failed during initial finalization (pre-RLS fix)

### RLS Fix Impact Analysis
- ‚úÖ Service role policies successfully applied
- ‚úÖ Edge functions can now write to both tables
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue**: Session was finalized BEFORE RLS fix, so profile creation failed
- üîÑ **Solution**: Re-invoke finalizeAssessment to complete profile creation

## Evidence Collection Status: **NEEDS FUNCTION RE-INVOCATION**

### Current Status Summary
| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| RLS Policies | ‚úÖ APPLIED | Both tables now have service role access |
| FC Scores | ‚úÖ PRESENT | v1.2, valid JSON object |
| Profile Creation | ‚ùå FAILED | Blocked by old RLS, needs re-invocation |
| HTTP Access | ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING | Cannot test without profile |
| Telemetry | ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING | Need function call logs |

## Next Action Required: **MANUAL FUNCTION INVOCATION**

The finalizeAssessment function must be invoked with service role to:
1. Create the missing profile record with results_version='v1.2.1'
2. Generate proper results URL with working access
3. Complete evidence collection process

**Command**: Execute `run_finalize_assessment.js` with service role key

## Expected Post-Invocation Results
- ‚úÖ Profile created with `results_version = 'v1.2.1'`
- ‚úÖ Results URL accessible with token (200 response)  
- ‚úÖ Results URL blocked without token (401/403 response)
- ‚úÖ Telemetry shows `fc_source=fc_scores` path
