# System Placeholder Audit Report

**Generated**: 2025-10-02  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive audit of placeholders, stubs, and incomplete implementations across the PRISM assessment platform  
**Context**: This report identifies all non-functional or incomplete code that needs implementation or removal before production deployment.

---

## Executive Summary

**Status**: ⚠️ MIXED - Core functionality operational, but several dashboard metrics and evidence features are incomplete

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ Core assessment flow fully functional (PRISM v1.2.1)
- ✅ Primary scoring and type detection operational
- ⚠️ Advanced psychometric metrics exist but contain placeholder data
- ⚠️ Evidence/validation dashboard has stub implementations
- ⚠️ Several materialized views return zeros/nulls (not yet populated)

## Part 1: Database Layer Placeholders

### 1.1 Materialized Views With Placeholder Data

#### **mv_kpi_cfa** (Confirmatory Factor Analysis)
**Location**: Database materialized view  
**Current State**: Returns all zeros (n=0, rmsea=0, cfi=0, tli=0, srmr=0)  
**What It Should Do**: Measure how well the assessment's latent structure fits the theoretical PRISM model using CFA metrics  
**Why It Matters**: Critical for validating that the 8 cognitive functions are measuring distinct constructs  
**Impact If Not Fixed**: Can't demonstrate construct validity to researchers or institutions  
**Dependencies**: Requires CFA computation script using lavaan (R) or similar  

#### **mv_kpi_construct_coverage** (Item-to-Construct Mapping)
**Location**: Database materialized view  
**Current State**: Returns zeros (total_items=0, keyed_items=0, coverage_pct=0)  
**What It Should Do**: Show how many items map to each cognitive function (Te, Ti, Fe, Fi, etc.)  
**Why It Matters**: Ensures balanced representation of all 8 functions in the assessment  
**Impact If Not Fixed**: Can't verify assessment isn't biased toward certain functions  
**Dependencies**: Requires proper `item_catalog` and `scale_catalog` population  

#### **mv_kpi_fairness_dif** (Differential Item Functioning)
**Location**: Database materialized view  
**Current State**: Returns zeros (flagged_items=0, total_tested=0, max_dif=0)  
**What It Should Do**: Detect items that perform differently across demographic groups (age, gender, culture)  
**Why It Matters**: Critical for fairness - ensures assessment doesn't systematically favor/disadvantage groups  
**Impact If Not Fixed**: Potential bias issues, legal/ethical concerns for institutional use  
**Dependencies**: Requires DIF analysis script (IRT-based or Mantel-Haenszel)  

#### **mv_kpi_classification_stability** (Type Consistency)
**Location**: Database materialized view  
**Current State**: Returns zeros (stable=0, adjacent=0, distant=0, kappa=0)  
**What It Should Do**: Track how often retests produce same type vs adjacent types vs completely different types  
**Why It Matters**: High stability = reliable assessment; high adjacent flips = okay; high distant flips = problem  
**Impact If Not Fixed**: Can't demonstrate test-retest reliability of type classifications  
**Dependencies**: Requires `psychometrics_retest_pairs` table to be populated  

#### **mv_kpi_followup** (Longitudinal Tracking)
**Location**: Database materialized view  
**Current State**: Returns zeros (users_with_followup=0, median_days_to_followup=0)  
**What It Should Do**: Track users who complete follow-up assessments and timing patterns  
**Why It Matters**: Enables longitudinal research on personality stability and development  
**Impact If Not Fixed**: No visibility into retest patterns or user engagement over time  
**Dependencies**: Requires tracking repeat assessments by user_id  

#### **mv_kpi_behavioral_impact** (Real-World Application)
**Location**: Database materialized view  
**Current State**: Returns NULLs for all fields  
**What It Should Do**: Track whether users report behavioral changes after seeing results  
**Why It Matters**: Demonstrates real-world utility of assessment beyond just "interesting results"  
**Impact If Not Fixed**: No evidence of assessment's practical value for personal development  
**Dependencies**: Requires follow-up survey data collection  

#### **mv_kpi_trajectory_alignment** (Growth Tracking)
**Location**: Database materialized view  
**Current State**: Returns NULLs for all fields  
**What It Should Do**: Track whether users' development paths align with their type's predicted growth trajectories  
**Why It Matters**: Validates PRISM's developmental model predictions  
**Impact If Not Fixed**: Can't validate the theoretical framework's predictive power  
**Dependencies**: Requires longitudinal data + growth trajectory models  

### 1.2 Empty Tables (Recently Created, Awaiting Data)

#### **psychometrics_external** (External Validity Data)
**Location**: `public.psychometrics_external` table  
**Current State**: Empty (0 rows)  
**What It Should Contain**: Cronbach's α, McDonald's ω, SEM for each scale/function  
**Data Source**: Computed from batch analysis of assessment response data  
**Priority**: HIGH - Just integrated into dashboard, needs immediate population  
**Script Needed**: Python/R reliability computation using raw response matrices  

#### **psychometrics_retest_pairs** (Test-Retest Data)
**Location**: `public.psychometrics_retest_pairs` table  
**Current State**: Empty (0 rows)  
**What It Should Contain**: Pearson r correlations between first/second attempts for each scale  
**Data Source**: Paired analysis of users who completed assessment multiple times  
**Priority**: HIGH - Just integrated into dashboard, needs immediate population  
**Script Needed**: Python/R script to identify retest pairs and compute correlations  

#### **mv_kpi_reliability** (Internal Consistency Metrics)
**Location**: Database materialized view (aggregates from `psychometrics_external`)  
**Current State**: Returns empty array `[]`  
**What It Should Do**: Show Cronbach's α and McDonald's ω for each cognitive function scale  
**Why It Matters**: Demonstrates scales are internally consistent (items measure same construct)  
**Impact If Not Fixed**: Can't claim assessment has acceptable reliability standards  
**Dependencies**: Requires `psychometrics_external` table population first  

#### **mv_kpi_retest** (Test-Retest Reliability Metrics)
**Location**: Database materialized view (aggregates from `psychometrics_retest_pairs`)  
**Current State**: Returns empty array `[]`  
**What It Should Do**: Show test-retest correlations (stability over time) for each scale  
**Why It Matters**: Demonstrates assessment measures stable traits, not temporary states  
**Impact If Not Fixed**: Can't claim results are stable/reliable over time  
**Dependencies**: Requires `psychometrics_retest_pairs` table population first

## Part 2: Frontend Code Stubs

### 2.1 Complete Stub Implementations

#### **useEvidenceAnalytics.ts**
**Location**: `src/hooks/useEvidenceAnalytics.ts`  
**Current State**: Returns null data, false loading, no functionality  
**Original Purpose**: Hook for fetching evidence-based validity metrics  
**Current Usage**: Referenced by legacy Evidence tab components  
**Recommendation**: **DELETE** - Replaced by `useAssessmentKpis` hook  
**Impact**: No impact if removed; legacy code path  

### 2.2 Placeholder UI Components

#### **EnhancedEvidenceCards.tsx** (Three Placeholder Cards)
**Location**: `src/components/admin/evidence/EnhancedEvidenceCards.tsx`  
**Components**:
1. `StateTraitSeparationCard` - Shows "Coming Soon" for R² separation metrics
2. `OverlayInvarianceCard` - Shows "Coming Soon" for overlay stability across regulation states
3. `DimensionalityReliabilityCard` - Shows "Coming Soon" for Cohen's kappa across dimensions

**Current State**: All render "Coming Soon" badges with placeholder text  
**Design Intent**: Advanced psychometric cards for PRISM v1.1+ features  
**Recommendation Options**:
- **Option A**: Remove entirely if not on roadmap
- **Option B**: Implement with real calculations if needed for v1.2.1
- **Option C**: Keep as intentional "roadmap preview" with clear messaging

**Impact**: Currently just visual noise in dashboard; doesn't break anything

## Part 3: Hardcoded Defaults (Acceptable)

### 3.1 Relational Fit Data
**Location**: `src/data/relationalFit.ts`  
**Content**: Hardcoded compatibility matrices and relationship insights

## Part 6: Recommendations by Stakeholder

### **For Product Team**
**Immediate**: Hide empty reliability section until data populated, or show "Computing..." state  
**Short-term**: Decide on evidence cards (remove vs implement vs roadmap preview)  
**Long-term**: Define research roadmap for behavioral impact and trajectory features  

### **For Engineering Team**
**Immediate**: Run reliability computation script (#1), populate retest pairs (#2)  
**Short-term**: Remove stub hook (#3), fix construct coverage view (#4)  
**Long-term**: Build infrastructure for follow-up surveys and longitudinal tracking  

### **For Research Team**
**Immediate**: Review reliability results once computed  
**Short-term**: Define CFA model specification for construct validation  
**Long-term**: Design behavioral impact research protocol  

### **For Leadership**
**Decision Needed**: 
- Should we show incomplete metrics (with "Coming Soon") or hide them?
- What's the timeline for research features (DIF, CFA, longitudinal)?
- Is institutional credibility (requires CFA/DIF) a priority?
