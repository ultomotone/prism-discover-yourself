**Function**: finalizeAssessment  
**Log Collection Time**: 2025-09-17T17:12:30Z  
**Query Window**: Last 2 hours

## Edge Function Execution Logs

### Recent Function Activity Query
```sql
select id, function_edge_logs.timestamp, event_message, response.status_code, 
       request.method, m.function_id, m.execution_time_ms, m.deployment_id, m.version 
from function_edge_logs
  cross join unnest(metadata) as m
  cross join unnest(m.response) as response
  cross join unnest(m.request) as request
where function_edge_logs.timestamp > now() - interval '2 hours'
  AND (event_message ILIKE '%finalizeAssessment%' OR event_message ILIKE '%finalize%')
order by timestamp desc
limit 50;
```

**Result**: ❌ **NO EXECUTION LOGS FOUND**
- Query returned empty array `[]`
- No evidence of finalizeAssessment function calls in last 2 hours

## Log Analysis Summary

### Function Invocation Evidence: ❌ **ABSENT**
- No POST requests to finalizeAssessment detected
- No function execution timestamps
- No response status codes recorded
- No execution time metrics available

### Possible Explanations:
1. **Function Not Deployed**: Edge function may not be deployed to production
2. **No Recent Invocations**: Function exists but hasn't been called recently
3. **Logging Issues**: Function executing but logs not being captured
4. **Network/Routing**: Requests not reaching the function endpoint

## Console Application Logs

**Search Term**: "finalizeAssessment"  
**Result**: No logs found

## Network Request Logs  

**Search Term**: "finalize"  
**Result**: No results

## Conclusion

**Status**: ❌ **NO FUNCTION ACTIVITY DETECTED**

The absence of logs indicates either:
- Function deployment issues preventing execution
- No recent invocation attempts reaching the function
- Potential routing/endpoint configuration problems

**Next Action**: Execute comprehensive authentication tests to determine if function is accessible and responsive to direct invocation attempts.

**Log Status**: Ready to capture new execution evidence from upcoming comprehensive test.
