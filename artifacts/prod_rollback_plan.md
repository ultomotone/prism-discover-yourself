# Production Rollback Plan

**Generated**: 2025-09-17T19:54:16.536Z
**Target Deployment**: Engine v1.2.1, FC v1.2

## Rollback Status: ✅ NOT REQUIRED

### Current Situation
- **Production State**: Already at target configuration (v1.2.1)
- **Deployment Type**: Verification-only (no changes applied)
- **Risk Level**: None (no configuration modifications)

## Rollback Trigger Conditions

Execute rollback only if verification testing reveals issues:
- ❌ finalizeAssessment function fails verification
- ❌ Incorrect version stamps detected  
- ❌ Token gating bypassed or compromised
- ❌ Any security control failure during testing

## Emergency Rollback Commands (If Needed)

### 1. Revert Configuration (Theoretical)
```sql
-- Current production value (no change needed)
SELECT key, value, updated_at 
FROM scoring_config 
WHERE key = 'results_version';
-- Expected result: value = 'v1.2.1'
```

### 2. Verification Commands
```sql  
-- Confirm current state
SELECT key, value, updated_at 
FROM scoring_config 
WHERE key = 'results_version';

-- Check for any anomalous profiles
SELECT COUNT(*) as recent_profiles_count,
       results_version
FROM profiles 
WHERE created_at > '2025-09-17T19:00:00Z'
GROUP BY results_version;
```

## Manual Rollback Steps

### Emergency Procedure (if verification fails)
1. **Immediate**: No configuration rollback needed
2. **Investigation**: Review verification failure logs
3. **Communication**: Notify relevant teams
4. **Resolution**: Address underlying issue (not configuration)

### Communication Plan
1. **Incident**: Log verification failure details
2. **Stakeholders**: Notify if verification issues found
3. **Post-mortem**: Only if systematic issues discovered

## Recovery Validation

Since no changes are applied, validation focuses on:
- ✅ scoring_config remains at v1.2.1
- ✅ Verification tests pass after fixes
- ✅ No unintended side effects

## Rollback Artifacts

For this deployment:
- **Pre-deployment State**: Already documented (v1.2.1)
- **Changes Applied**: None
- **Rollback Actions**: None required
- **Recovery Complexity**: Minimal (investigation only)

---
**Rollback Readiness**: ✅ Ready (but not expected to be needed)
**Estimated Recovery Time**: Investigation-dependent
**Data Loss Risk**: None (verification-only deployment)
