**Artifacts**: staging_observability.md, staging_soak_gate.md

**Key Achievements**:
- Zero engine version overrides detected
- Zero legacy FC source usage
- Conversion rate above baseline (91.7% vs 89.2%)
- All version stamps correct
- Security controls validated

### Phase 3: Production Health Check ✅
**Status**: ✅ HEALTHY
