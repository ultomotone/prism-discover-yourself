# IR-07A: RLS Remediation - Apply Logs

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-17T04:15:00Z  
**Environment**: Staging  
**Issue**: profiles table RLS blocking 100% of profile writes

## Root Cause Confirmed
- **profiles** table had RLS enabled but **NO POLICIES** 
- Result: All access denied, including service role writes
- Impact: 20+ days of complete profile generation failure

## Applied Changes

### Database Migration Applied Successfully
```sql
-- Added service role management policy
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage profiles" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR ALL 
TO public
USING (auth.role() = 'service_role')
WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Added user read access policy  
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profiles" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR SELECT 
TO public
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Policy Verification
- **Service role policy**: ✅ Active - Enables edge functions to write profiles
- **User read policy**: ✅ Active - Allows users to view own profiles via user_id
- **Anonymous access**: ❌ Blocked - No public read/write access

## Security Analysis
- Migration completed with expected security warnings
- Warnings are mostly about other tables with intended public read access
- **profiles** table now properly secured with targeted policies
- No new critical security issues introduced

## Next Steps - IMMEDIATE TESTING REQUIRED

### 1. Test Profile Creation
```bash
# Test finalizeAssessment for recent session
curl -X POST "${STAGING_URL}/functions/v1/finalizeAssessment" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SERVICE_ROLE_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id": "618c5ea6-aeda-4084-9156-0aac9643afd3"}'

# Expected: Success with profile created (results_version: "v1.2.1")
```

### 2. Verify Database Write
```sql
-- Check if profile was created
SELECT id, session_id, type_code, results_version, created_at 
FROM profiles 
WHERE session_id = '618c5ea6-aeda-4084-9156-0aac9643afd3';

-- Expected: 1 row with results_version = 'v1.2.1'
```

### 3. Test Results Access
```bash  
# Test results page with share token
curl "${STAGING_URL}/results/618c5ea6-aeda-4084-9156-0aac9643afd3?t=${SHARE_TOKEN}"

# Expected: 200 OK with profile data
```

## Success Criteria Met
- [x] RLS policies restored for profiles table
- [x] Service role write access enabled
- [x] User read access properly scoped
- [x] Anonymous access blocked
- [ ] **PENDING**: Test profile creation end-to-end
- [ ] **PENDING**: Verify results access enforcement

## Risk Assessment
- **Change Impact**: Minimal, targeted fix
- **Rollback Time**: < 5 minutes (drop policies)
- **Security Risk**: Low (policies follow least-privilege principle)

**Status**: Ready for immediate end-to-end testing  
**Next**: Run IR-09A verification to confirm pipeline restoration
