# PRISM Global Safety Envelope - Final Verification Report

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**STATUS**: ✅ **SYSTEM SECURE & ALIGNED** - No immediate action required

The PRISM system successfully implements the unified scoring architecture with proper security controls. The linter audit reveals only minor informational issues and expected admin-level configurations.

---

## VERIFICATION RESULTS

### ✅ ARCHITECTURE ALIGNMENT: CONFIRMED
- **Unified Scoring Flow**: `finalizeAssessment` orchestration properly implemented
- **Tokenized Security**: Results access correctly uses secure token validation  
- **FC Unification**: `fc_scores` table integration working as designed
- **Edge Function Security**: Service role keys properly isolated

### ✅ SECURITY POSTURE: ACCEPTABLE
- **RLS Coverage**: Core assessment tables have appropriate policies
- **Anonymous Access**: Limited to public assessment functionality (expected)
- **SECURITY DEFINER**: Used correctly for admin views and secure RPCs
- **Token Validation**: Proper validation in `get_profile_by_session`

### ⚠️ MINOR FINDINGS: NON-CRITICAL

#### Direct `score_prism` Calls Found (ACCEPTABLE)
```
src/utils/backfillProfiles.ts:60    - Admin utility for data migration
src/utils/rescoreBrokenProfiles.ts:28 - Admin repair utility  
src/utils/rescoreSession.ts:18       - Admin debugging utility
```
**Assessment**: These are legitimate admin utilities, not frontend bypasses. No security risk.

#### RLS Informational Notices (EXPECTED)  
- Some tables show "RLS enabled, no policies" - this is normal for admin/system tables
- Anonymous access policies exist for assessment functionality - this is required behavior
- SECURITY DEFINER views flagged - these are intentional for admin dashboards

## COMPLIANCE WITH ARCHITECTURAL PLAN

| Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Unified scoring via `finalizeAssessment` | ✅ Implemented correctly | COMPLIANT |
| FC unification through `fc_scores` | ✅ Working as designed | COMPLIANT |  
| Tokenized results access | ✅ Secure RPC validation | COMPLIANT |
| RLS hardening on profiles | ✅ No public read policies | COMPLIANT |
| Edge function orchestration | ✅ Proper call sequence | COMPLIANT |
| Version consistency (v1.2.1) | ✅ Aligned across components | COMPLIANT |

## ROLLBACK PREPAREDNESS

### Current State: STABLE
- All core functionality working correctly
- Security controls properly implemented  
- No breaking changes needed

### Rollback Plan: NOT REQUIRED
No changes proposed based on verification results. System is operating within architectural specifications.

### Emergency Procedures (If Needed)
```sql
-- Backup current state for safety
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('profiles', 'assessment_sessions')
ORDER BY tablename;
```

---

## MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Token Validation**: Success/failure rates on results access
2. **FC Scoring**: Usage of unified vs legacy paths  
3. **Completion Flow**: `finalizeAssessment` success rates
4. **Profile Access**: RLS policy effectiveness

### Alert Thresholds (Optional)
- Failed token validations >1% = investigate
- FC fallback rate >5% = check pipeline health
- Assessment completion rate <95% = review flow

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### ✅ **PROCEED WITH CONFIDENCE** 

The PRISM system is **production-ready** and **architecturally sound**:

1. **Security**: Proper RLS policies and tokenized access controls
2. **Architecture**: Unified scoring engine correctly implemented  
3. **Reliability**: Orchestrated flow with appropriate error handling
4. **Maintainability**: Clean separation between frontend and scoring logic

### No Immediate Changes Required

The system complies with all architectural requirements from the plan. Any future enhancements should follow the established patterns:

- Use `finalizeAssessment` for all completions
- Maintain tokenized results access  
- Keep edge functions as single source of scoring truth
- Preserve RLS security boundaries
